# mouseTouHou
A program to make Touhou available for mouse controlling.
# A faster, smoother, more optimized version
This version is a faster, and less laggier version than the original version of the program.

By adding a bool value to indicate whether the mouse speed have been changed, this remove dramatically the constant mouse speed writing which causes the intensive lag.
# Todo
Maybe change this into C#, since it's quite easier to look at than C++.
There's still some wide string casting bug, which can be fixed easily.
